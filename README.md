# Todo List App 📝🚀  

A lightweight and responsive **React-based Todo List App** with performance optimizations and RESTful API integration using Axios.  

## 🔥 Performance Insights  

- **Efficient State Management** 🧠  
  - Utilizes React's state efficiently to minimize unnecessary re-renders.  
  - Optimized `setState()` to prevent redundant updates.  

- **API Optimization** 🌐  
  - Uses Axios for **asynchronous data fetching** with controlled state updates.  
  - Limits API requests (`?_limit=5`) for **faster loading times**.  

- **Event Handling & UI Responsiveness** ⚡  
  - Uses functional programming techniques (`map`, `filter`) for optimized event handling.  
  - Button interactions and state updates are handled with **minimal reflows**.  

- **Code Efficiency & Readability** 🎯  
  - Refactored redundant logic for toggling completion state.  
  - Improved function naming and prop passing for better maintainability.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Add, remove, and mark todos as complete/incomplete.  
✅ Clear all, check all, and uncheck all todos with a single click.  
✅ RESTful API integration for data persistence.
